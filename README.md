## About this Project

This project was developed for educational purposes under the [Reboot 01 curriculum](https://reboot01.com/curriculum/).

Ascii Art Web is the sequel to a [previous project]() of the same curriculum at Reboot. The idea is to gently learn the basics of the front and back end development process using "Vanilla" Golang. As our first web application using Golang's standard library, minimalism is key so as long as the expectation is far from any funky designs or the next Mona Lisa, the project is sure to intrigue.

Have fun!

## Objective

Ascii-Art-Web is a web application that converts plain text into the user's choice of three simple ascii art designs and displays it on the same page.

The learning objective of Ascii Art Web is to get familiar with the Golang web development process through building web page structures, templates, css styling, routing, DOM manipulation, GET & POST endpoints, and other good stuff that comes with learning how to build websites.
