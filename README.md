## About this Project

This project was developed for educational purposes under the [Reboot 01 curriculum](https://reboot01.com/curriculum/).

Ascii Art Web is the sequel to a [previous project]() of the same curriculum at Reboot. The idea behind this project is to gently learn the basics of front and back-end development process by  integrating the logic of [Ascii-Art]() into the browser using "Vanilla" Golang and html templates. As our first web application using Golang's standard library, minimalism is key so as long as the expectation is far from any contemporary, funky designs or the next Mona Lisa, the project is sure to intrigue. 

It has certainly been a labor of love working on this one, so whether you're here to judge us on our programming chops or ~~to steal~~ seek inspiration through our code, we are quite delighted to share our work with you. Have fun!

## Objective

Ascii-Art-Web is a web application that converts user plain text input into the user's choice of three simple ascii art designs and displays it on the same page.

The learning objective of Ascii Art Web was to get familiar with the Golang web development process through building web page structures, templates, css styling, routing, DOM manipulation, GET & POST endpoints, and other good stuff that comes with learning how to build websites.
