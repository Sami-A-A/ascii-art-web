## About this Project

This project was developed for educational purposes under the [Reboot 01 curriculum](https://reboot01.com/curriculum/).

Ascii Art Web is the sequel to a [previous project]() of the same curriculum at Reboot. The idea behind this project is to gently learn the basics of front and back-end development process by  integrating the logic of [Ascii-Art]() into the browser using "Vanilla" Golang and html templates. As our first web application using Golang's standard library, minimalism is key so as long as the expectation is far from any contemporary, funky designs or the next Mona Lisa, the project is sure to intrigue. 

It has certainly been a labor of love working on this one, so whether you're here to judge us on our programming chops or ~~to steal~~ seek inspiration through our code, we are quite delighted to share our work with you. Have fun!

## Objective

Ascii-Art-Web is a web application that converts user plain text input into the user's choice of three simple ascii art designs and displays it on the same page.

The learning objective of Ascii Art Web was to get familiar with the Golang web development process through building web page structures, templates, css styling, routing, DOM manipulation, GET & POST endpoints, and other good stuff that comes with learning how to build websites.

## Usage

You may visit the deployed application [here]() (work in progress).

Or if you're name is Zeeshan and you are currently viewing this README you can just follow these steps to set up everything on your local machine so you can get started



>On the terminal navigate to your project folder and use the following command:
>
>```$ git clone https://learn.reboot01.com/git/sabdulaa/ascii-art-web.git```
>
> - *this creates a folder called ascii-art-web with .git already initialized so you don't need to make a new folder called "ascii-art" or anything before pulling*
>
>```$ git fetch --all```
>
> * *this copies all the branches in the remote repository*  
>
> On the terminal run the following command
>
>```$ git checkout dev-2```
>
>* *You can work on this branch. I made sure to make it identical to the branch I'm working on (dev-1) and any changes you make won't affect the other branches (until we merge and resolve any conflicts) so go ham*
>
>On the terminal navigate to the ```/cmd``` folder.  
>
>Use ```$ go run main.go``` anytime you want to start the server and use ``` ctrl + c ``` to stop the server. It should be running on http://localhost:8080
>
> When you push or pull any changes make sure to use the following
>
> ```$ git push origin dev-2```  
> ```$ git pull origin dev-2```
>
>* *I might be missing a few instructions but basically you just need to be in the right branch when you make changes so when you push it doesn't break the code.*
>* *Some nice tips: commit often and preferably commit only when the program actually runs so if there are any lines causing errors, comment them out*
